Output existing HeadSpace2 data without the original plugin. Deactivate HeadSpace2 (no longer maintained) without impactacting legacy content.

== Description ==

Outputs data stored in HeadSpace2 post meta without requiring HeadSpace2. This allows one to remove the now-unmaintained HeadSpace2 plugin without losing the data associated with legacy content.

Note that many current SEO plugins for WordPress also handle migration, but since I don't use any such plugins on my network, I created this alternative.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/eth-escape-headspace` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I modify existing data using this plugin? =

No. If you need to update entries, reinstall HeadSpace2 or modify the values directly in the database.
